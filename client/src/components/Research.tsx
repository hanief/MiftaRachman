        <h3 className="subsection-title">Methodology</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Our research employs whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to identify genetic markers associated with important traits in livestock. We use molecular genetic techniques to characterize polymorphisms and study their association with phenotypic variations. Our approach combines field sampling, laboratory analysis, and computational methods to generate comprehensive genetic profiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          For heat-stress adaptation studies, we analyze genetic variations that contribute to thermotolerance in indigenous livestock breeds. This involves identifying selection signatures and genetic loci associated with adaptation to tropical environments, which is crucial for developing climate-resilient livestock breeding programs.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Our research on Nigerian indigenous chickens has revealed important genetic adaptations to heat stress, contributing valuable knowledge for poultry breeding programs in tropical regions. The identification of genetic polymorphisms in local cattle breeds provides markers for selection and genetic improvement programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Studies on Wolbachia infection in insects contribute to understanding endosymbiotic relationships and potential applications in insect population control. Overall, our research supports sustainable livestock development, genetic conservation of indigenous breeds, and adaptation strategies for climate change challenges in agriculture.
