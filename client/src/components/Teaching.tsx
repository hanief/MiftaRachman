          I supervise graduate and undergraduate students conducting research in livestock genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics. Students in my laboratory gain hands-on experience with molecular genetic techniques, whole genome sequence analysis, and interpretation of genetic data for livestock improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          My mentorship approach emphasizes developing both technical laboratory skills and computational methods for analyzing complex genomic data. I encourage students to participate in international research collaborations and present their findings at scientific conferences, preparing them for careers in both academic research and the agricultural industry.
